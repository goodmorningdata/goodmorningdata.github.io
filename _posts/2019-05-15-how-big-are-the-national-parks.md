For a few posts I will just concentrate on the 61 national parks. How big are they? Are they all close to the same size?

The map below shows the size of all the national parks with a circle relative to their area (not the actual park boundary). An interactive version of the map is found
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20190515_size_map_national_parks.html){:target="_blank"}. Hovering over the circles will tell you the park name and size in square miles. For the smaller parks, zoom in to see the size better relative to those parks around it and for ease of hovering.
