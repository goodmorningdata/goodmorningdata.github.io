In the last post, we looked at the number of visits to the national parks in 2018. Those numbers are interesting, but how do they compare to historical data? Have park visits been going up or down over time?

In the early days of the National Park Service, there was a push to get visitors to the often difficult to reach parks. To make them easier to reach, the railroads built rail lines to the parks and [grand lodges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier_Park_Lodge){:target="_blank"} for the visitors to stay in. The railroads and the park service jointly advertised, producing such campaigns as "See America First", encouraging Americans to visit their national parks instead of other popular destinations of the time such as Switzerland. More recently, the NPS produced a special advertising campaign for the 100th anniversary of the parks in 2016. Some of the parks get so many visits per year that they probably don't need any additional advertising, but letting people know about those lesser visited national park sites is certainly important.

The plot below shows total park visits for the national parks since 1904. A few things to point out:
* We see a small increase in visits until the start of WWII and then visits drop dramatically. Some parks, like [Mount Rainier National Park](https://www.nps.gov/articles/mtrainierwwiitraining.htm){:target="_blank"}, were used as military training sites during the war.
* After WWII, the population of the middle-class and car ownership increased, giving people the money and the transportation necessary to get to the national parks. Park visits increased at a fairly steady rate from the end of WWII through ~1995 with a few dips.
* The oil crisises of 1973 and 1979 surely contributed to the decreases in that decade.
* The Great Recession of 2007-9 likely caused the sustained decrease in visits during the latter half of the 2000s.
* In 2012 the number of visits jumped back up to higher than the pre-recession level.

### Data Sources
The list of 419 official park units (as of 5/1/2019) broken out by designation comes from the [National Park System](https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/national-park-system.htm){:target="_blank"} page at nps.gov. Park visit data from the report, "Annual Summary Report (1904 - Last Calendar Year)" found on the [NPS Stats](https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/reports/national){:target="_blank"} website. 2010-2018 U.S. population data from the [U.S. Census Bureau American Fact Finder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t). 1900-2009 U.S. population data from State Intercensal Tables found on [www.census.gov](www.census.gov).

### Using the Scripts
Instructions to run the scripts are found in the readme in the GitHub repository found [here](https://github.com/goodmorningdata/nps){:target="_blank"}.
