A blog of data science currently focusing on National Park Service data.

As I spend the year with my family, travelling to as many national parks as possible, I have been taking online courses and teaching myself data science skills. This blog is a way to demonstrate and practice those skills while dealing with data about one of my favorite subjects.

Code repository available on [GitHub](https://github.com/goodmorningdata/nps).
