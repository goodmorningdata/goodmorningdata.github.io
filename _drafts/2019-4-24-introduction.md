Hi. My name is Amy Corner Erwin. I am learning to be a data scientist and I created this blog as a way to publish data science projects that I am working on. The national parks are a favorite of mine and the bulk of the posts here deal with the National Park Service and the data that I am able to find about the topic. I also have taken Coursera classes and work on Kaggle projects and will occasionaly publish posts dealing with those topics.
