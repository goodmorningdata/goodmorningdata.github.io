New parks are added to the National Park system every year, and there are two ways to do it. Congress can add new units by an Act of Congress with the last one being the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act on March 12, 2019. This latest Act added 2 new parks, redesignated 6 others, and authorized 2 national monuments still awaiting land acquisition. The sitting president can also create parks with the designation of national monument from federal land using a presidential proclamation by way of the Antiquities Act of 1906. Seeing the destruction and looting of prehistoric artifacts and areas important to our geologic history in the American West, President Theodore Roosevelt (go Teddy!) oversaw the establishment of the Antiquities Act, and then used it to protect first Devils Tower in Wyoming, and then such sites as Mesa Verde, and Grand Canyon.
